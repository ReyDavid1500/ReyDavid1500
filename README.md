👨🏻‍💻 I’m a Software Engineer with experience in modern web development, currently focused on backend engineering using NestJS within a microservices monorepo architecture. My background spans building scalable and maintainable applications with TypeScript, React, and Node.js, and I take pride in writing clean, testable, and reliable code supported by Jest and robust CI/CD pipelines.

🚀 I’m passionate about designing systems that balance performance and maintainability. In my current role, I work on distributed backend services that handle asynchronous communication, improve system modularity, and enhance development efficiency across teams.

🔧 Technologies & Tools: TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, Express, React, TailwindCSS, Next.js, REST APIs, SQLServer, MongoDB, Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, Jest, GitHub Actions, Git, ESLint, Prettier, Agile, Scrum.

💡 I’m especially interested in scalable Frontend and backend architectures, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), event-driven systems, and AI-supported development workflows.

📚 Outside of coding, I enjoy learning languages (currently German 🇩🇪) hiking and grilling.
